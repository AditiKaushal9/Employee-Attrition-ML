# Employee-Attrition-ML
Employee Attrition Prediction using ML

The main aim of this analysis is to help HR department to predict the Attrition and give the insights from the data
about the important factors associated with the attrition so that HR can take the corrective or
previntive measures to stop or control the attrition.

# Methodology

 - Data Wrangling - `Removed duplicates and dropped misssing or null values in the dataset.`
 - Exploratory Data Analysis - `Analyzed the data and summarized the main characteristics.`
 - Data Visualization - `Used boxplot, distribution plot, scatter plot, swarm plot, factor plot and count plot to visualize the data and it's characteristics.`
 - Machine Learning Algorithms Used - `Decision Tree Classifier`
 - Evaluation Metrics Used - `ROC-AUC, Recall and confusion matrix`

# Technologies/Libraries Used
``` 
 - Python 3
 - Jupyter
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - Scikit-Learn

# Recommendations

 - As the employees within the range of 26-33 age group are having high attrition rate so the company should understand the reason behind why they are significantly more likely    to resign.The reason could be like work pressure or else they are planning for higher studies,etc.There could be many more reasons.The company should research and find          appropriate measures to reduce the attrition rate.

 - By the analysis we got to know that the attrition rate for male employees is higher as compared to the female employees and also the male employees travel more frequently,      which could be one of the reason for their resign.The company may use incentives to motivate the employees who travel.

 - The employees having monthly income within 2500-4000 are the majority of people likely to resign.The company may give some percent salary hike.Higher the percent salary hike,    more will be the employees willing to stay in the same company.

 - The employees with less job satisfaction shows high attrition rate.The job satisfaction could get harm due to many factors such as low package,more workload,unhealthy work 
   environment,frequent business travelling,etc.So the company should look into these issues and find some better solutions so that the attrition rate can be reduced.
